Standby out of Newark September 14, 2021|44 min 14+ When Lidia (Jennifer Finnigan), the eldest of the dysfunctional Finley-Cullen clan returns home from New York for her Aunt’s funeral, her whole life is torn down in a weekend. Her marriage implodes, her kids turn on her, and a surprise inheritance kicks off a family feud with her rival sister. There’s only one rational move – leave. Instead, Lidia doubles down. She’s going to stay and she’s going to make her new life work (or die trying).

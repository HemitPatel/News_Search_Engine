Version | 1.11.54 The Sunday Magazine with Piya Chattopadhyay Goodbye, Eastern Europe Play Segment23:34 Since the Soviet era, the caricature of eastern Europe has been of a “gray, sunless place where no one ever smiles”. But to Jacob Mikanowski, the region stretching from the Baltics to the Balkans is so much more. The journalist and author joins guest host Megan Williams to discuss eastern Europe’s diverse history, his own family’s complicated story of survival and how recent conflicts, from the Second World War to the fall of Yugoslavia and the current war in Ukraine, have destroyed what he describes as the “ramshackle utopia” that eastern Europe used to represent.
